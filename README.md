# Technologies used

## Star Wars API - React project

The brief was to:
* build a web page that displays Star War characters in a table,
* add pagination,
* add search functionality for a specific character by name (powered by the APIâ€™s search parameter).

The project consumes data from [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/).

The site can be run locally by cloning the repository and typing ```yarn``` and then ```yarn run start``` in the terminal.

### App overview

The application allows a user to search for a starwars character by name, returning the results under the search input. Alternatively, the user can just browse through 9 pages of Star Wars characters.

### Future enhancements
* Upgrading the API to show character images.
* Create a Character Show page, entailing all details about the selected character.
